# FUSE-File-System

This project was an assignment for my Operating Systems class at Stevens.

The goal of tis project was to implement a file system that utilized an i-node structure. There is a more detailed diagram in the pdf. I worked with two other students on this project and did our best to complete it. The program read from a disk image to build the file structures and then the files could be accessed through the program like on a terminal shell.
